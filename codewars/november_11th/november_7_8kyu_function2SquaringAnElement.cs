Now you have to write a function called square that takes an argument and returns the square of it.

using System;

public class Kata
{
  // Write a static function "Square" here which takes a double
  // and returns the square of that double
  public static double Square(double a) => Math.Pow(a, 2);
}

public class Kata
{
  public static double Square(double x) => x * x;
}
